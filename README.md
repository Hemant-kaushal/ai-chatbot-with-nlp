## AI Chatbot with Natural Language Processing

### **Project Overview**

This project is part of my **2025 Summer Internship Task 3: AI Chatbot with NLP**.

The goal of this project is to build a **rule-based AI chatbot** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques with **NLTK**.  
The chatbot is capable of **interacting with users, recognizing greetings and farewells, and responding to basic queries** in a conversational manner.

The chatbot runs in the **command-line interface (CLI)** and responds based on **pattern matching using regular expressions**.

---

### **What the Project Does**

- Provides an **interactive conversational interface** through the terminal.
- Uses **NLTK's `Chat` module** for easy pattern-response mapping.
- Recognizes and responds to:
- **Greetings** (e.g., hello, hi)
- **Farewells** (e.g., bye, quit, goodbye)
- **Contextual Questions** (e.g., name, weather, time, help)
- Provides **fallback responses** for unknown queries.
- Allows **easy customization** by modifying pattern-response pairs in the code.

### **Technologies Used**

- **Python 3**  
- **NLTK** â€“ For Natural Language Processing and chatbot pattern matching

---

### **Input and Output**

- **Input:**  
  User queries via command-line input.

- **Output:**  
  Automated text responses printed in the terminal simulating a conversation.
